I kept the design easy as the goal was to experiment with App Engine.
New additions to model:
- Game.history to store the dates of pushes
- New methods to separate concerns:
  - User.update_last_push() to set the last date of push
  - User.can_push() returns if the user can push or not (limited to 1 min,
  can be increased in production)
  - Game.update_history() adds an entry to the history
  - Game.push_luck() pushes luck
  - Game.cancel_game cancels game

Right now there's no point in cancelling the game, but maybe it will change
if the rules change.
