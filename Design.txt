This is a fairly simple game: Push your luck!
The rules:
- A user can have any open games as he wants
- But his actual score equals to his last score
- He can push his luck on a game. If he wins, the attemps is increased by 1
  which will be his new score.
  If he looses, his score become 0 and that game ends.
- Will you push your luck in your best game or start a new one?

I kept the design easy as the goal was to experiment with App Engine.
New addition to the model is the history in the Game class. Since there
are no arguments, the history contains only the date when the user pushed
his score.

I've added new methods to the Game class as well:
- cancel game
- update history
So when if I decide to change the history (for example record the number of
open games when he pushed his luck on that game) I'll have to change only
that method.

Right now there's no point in cancelling the game, but maybe it will change
if the rules change.
